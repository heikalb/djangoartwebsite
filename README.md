# djangoartwebsite

This project is about building a Django version of my photography and 
painting website, https://heikalb.github.io/

The Django version of the website is deployed here: https://heikalb1.pythonanywhere.com

Both websites are functionally equivalent on the front end. One difference is that
the contact form is a Django form that sends me an email every time someone
submits a message (as opposed to a third party plug-in in the original website)
